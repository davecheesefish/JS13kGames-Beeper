#Beeper
A truck-reversing game built as an entry for the [JS13kGames contest 2015](http://2015.js13kgames.com/). Everything has been done to squeeze all I can out of the 13kB size limit, so this should definitely not be used an example of best programming practices!

##Development
###Setup
You will need:
- Node.js with npm
- pngcrush installed to a location in your PATH
- Compass installed to a location on your PATH

###Building
From the base directory, run `node build/build.js`. On completion, the finished files can be found in the dist folder.
